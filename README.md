## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We are trying to investigate house pricing and the factors that can contribute to a rise/decrease in house pricing.

Eventhough, our dataset is dated, we like the idea of being able to see how pricing changes as its location within California changes and also how it can potentially also give us insights into households.

There's a lot we can look at, like for example, how the pricing changes as houses get closer to the coastline. Or how the pricing changes as the house gets closer to a particular city.

It might be really interesting to see where an ideal location to buy/build a new house might be to sell for maximum price.

We may also be able to find anamolies where a good location would normally lead to high prices, but for some reason, the house prices on average are lower than others (maybe due to crime or derelict buildings). This may have shown us potential bargains in the market back in 1990 and it would be really cool to see the difference in prices now.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset is based on the 1990 census report of housing prices in California. It was cleaned and modified by the owner.

The data is mostly quantitative information about houses (value, no of bedrooms, etc), its residents (median age, median income, etc) and its location in relation to different city centres across California or the coast.

This database's main purpose, according to the owner, is that it's great for learning data analysis and machine learning.
