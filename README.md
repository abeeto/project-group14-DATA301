## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset is based on the 1990 census report of housing prices in California. It is a modified version of another dataset used in an academic paper published in 1997. It was cleaned and modified by the owner.

The data is mostly quantitative information about houses (value, no of bedrooms, etc), its residents (median age, median income, etc) and its location in relation to different city centres across California or the coast.

This database's main purpose, according to the owner, is that it's great for learning data analysis and machine learning.
